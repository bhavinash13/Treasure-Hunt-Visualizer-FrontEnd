# Treasure Hunt Visualizer
It is a Front-end Project which uses ***DSA algorithms*** like Linear Search, Binary Search and even Merge Sort ALgorithms and Sort the Boxes to find the hidden Treasure in them..
We developed a Front-end style web application using Tech stack like Html,Css,Javascript,DSA algorithms and more..
Once Visualize the DSA algorithms in a gamified-approach..
It's a very entertaining Treasure Hunt Visualizer Game to understand how the DSA algorithms works in real time.. We show you how the Tracing part happens in those Algorithms..
