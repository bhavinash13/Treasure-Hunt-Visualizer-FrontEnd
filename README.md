# Treasure Hunt Visualizer
It is a Front-end Project which uses ***DSA algorithms*** like Linear Search, Binary Search and even Merge Sort ALgorithms and Sort the Boxes to find the hidden Treasure in them..
We developed a Front-end style web application using Tech stack like **Html,Css,Javascript,DSA algorithms** and more..
Once Visualize the DSA algorithms in a ***gamified-approach***..
It's a very entertaining Treasure Hunt Visualizer Game to understand how the DSA algorithms works in real time.. We show you how the Tracing part happens in those Algorithms..


## Introduction to Treasure Hunt Visualizer
### What is Treasure Hunt Visualizer
Treasure Hunt Visualizer is an interactive algorithm demonstration tool designed to help players and learners understand searching and sorting algorithms through engaging visualizations. By selecting a set of wooden boxes filled with different treasures (gold, platinum, or rock), users can experience firsthand how algorithms work to locate the hidden gold box efficiently

### How It Works
Users select the number of wooden boxes they want to play with.
They choose to fill the boxes with gold, platinum, or rock.
Using powerful sorting and searching algorithms (like Merge Sort, Linear Search, and Binary Search), the tool visualizes the process of identifying the gold box with optimized efficiency.
Through animations and step-by-step explanations, users gain insight into how these algorithms process data and improve searching techniques.

### How to Use the Visualizer
Click "Play" – Start the interactive treasure hunt process. 
Select Number of Boxes – Define the number of wooden containers. 
Fill Boxes – Assign treasures inside each box. 
Sorting Stage – Watch how Merge Sort arranges the boxes based on weight.
Search Stage – Choose between: Linear Search: Step-by-step sequential checking. Binary Search: Optimized search for faster results.
Gold Discovery – The algorithm highlights the treasure box with the gold.
Algorithms Used in Treasure Hunt Visualizer
Merge Sort: Efficiently organizes boxes by weight before searching begins.
Linear Search: Searches one box at a time until gold is found.
Binary Search: Quickly finds the gold box by halving the search space.
Each algorithm is demonstrated visually so users can understand its effectiveness and complexity.
